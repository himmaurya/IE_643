 The exponential growth of academic research has increased the demand for effective tools to streamline
 access to relevant conference papers. This project addresses that need by creating a versatile retrieval
 tool designed to accomplish two main tasks: (a) generate a list of accepted papers for specific conferences
 and years, and (b) filter relevant papers from selected conferences based on a query sentence. 



 For starting this project follow the following steps :
 1. Go to Command prompt
 2. Type ' python -m streamlit run research2.py'
 3. A web interface will open on thatb interface you can select the conference , year and your query .
 4. Click on the submit button
 5. Top 5 research papers will be displayed in the decreasing order of relevance with first one being most relevant and last bein least relevant with rspect to the query.
